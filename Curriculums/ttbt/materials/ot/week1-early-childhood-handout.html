            <p>But Adam was lonely. "It's not good for Adam to be alone," God said. So God made a woman named Eve to be Adam's best friend and helper.</p>

            <p>Eve looked at the fruit. It looked so good! She took some and ate it. She gave some to Adam too, and he ate it.</p>
            <p>Right away, Adam and Eve felt scared and sad. They had disobeyed God! They tried to hide from God, but you can't hide from God.</p>
