# Through The Bible Together (TTBT) – Program Overview

## Purpose
Through The Bible Together (TTBT) is a curriculum designed for **multi-generational groups** (often families, but also extended families or unrelated groups) to journey through the Bible together.  
The goal is to establish a shared foundation of key Old Testament and New Testament stories and teachings while fostering spiritual growth across all ages.

## Vision & Biblical Foundation
TTBT is rooted in **Deuteronomy 6:6–9**, which calls God’s people to impress His words on their children and to discuss them continually in everyday life.  
By studying together, participants fulfill this command as faith is nurtured and reinforced across generations.

## Audience & Age Groups
TTBT content is designed with parallel tracks for the following groups:
- **Adults (18+)**
- **Youth (6th–12th grade)**
- **Kids (2nd–5th grade)**
- **Early Childhood (1st grade and below)**

Each track covers the same core Bible stories but is adapted for comprehension, discussion, and engagement appropriate to the age group.

## Program Structure
- **Two sessions** each year  
- **20 weeks per session** (40 total weeks of content)  
- Weekly lessons include story focus, scripture passages, and age-appropriate adaptations.

## Content Flow
1. **Old Testament (Session 1)**  
   - Core foundational stories: Creation, Adam & Eve, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, the Prophets, etc.  
   - Builds understanding of God’s covenant and His plan of redemption.

2. **New Testament (Session 2)**  
   - Stories and teachings of Jesus, early church, and key New Testament themes.  
   - Builds understanding of the Gospel and how the early church lived it out.  
   - [See: curriculum/ttbt/NT.md]  

## Guiding Principles
- **Story-Driven:** Lessons are structured around narrative flow rather than abstract concepts.  
- **Multi-Generational:** Families and groups study together, then break into age-appropriate tracks for deeper engagement.  
- **Relational:** Emphasis on conversation, questions, and practical application across all ages.  
- **Foundational:** Focused on establishing key stories and doctrines that form a biblical worldview.
